            <strong>Real Sociedad vs Manchester United</strong><br>
            Real Sociedad has been solid defensively at home, making them a tough opponent for any visiting side. Despite Manchester United's attacking firepower, their inconsistency this season, especially in away games, raises concerns. Sociedad’s ability to control possession and frustrate opponents could be key here. With home advantage and recent form, they are likely to edge this encounter in a closely fought battle. A 2-1 victory for Sociedad seems probable, though United’s attacking threats could make this an unpredictable affair.

            <strong>FC Copenhagen vs Chelsea</strong><br>
            Chelsea has been dominant in European competitions, and despite their struggles in the domestic league, they remain favorites against Copenhagen. The Danish side is well-organized defensively and could pose problems, especially at home, but Chelsea’s attacking depth should see them through. While Copenhagen may get on the scoresheet, Chelsea’s quality should ultimately shine, making a 2-1 victory the most reasonable prediction.

            <strong>Ajax Amsterdam vs Eintracht Frankfurt</strong><br>
            Ajax has historically been strong at home, but their defensive frailties this season have led to some unpredictable results. Eintracht Frankfurt, on the other hand, thrives in high-scoring matches and has a potent attack capable of breaking down Ajax’s defense. Given both teams' attacking tendencies and vulnerability at the back, a 2-2 draw seems a fair prediction, with both sides likely to create numerous goal-scoring opportunities.

            <strong>Fenerbahce Istanbul vs Glasgow Rangers</strong><br>
            Fenerbahce boasts an intimidating home atmosphere, making Istanbul a difficult place for visiting teams. Rangers have shown resilience in European competitions, but Fenerbahce's attacking strength and tactical discipline should give them the edge. The Turkish giants are expected to control possession and dictate the tempo, forcing Rangers onto the back foot. A 3-1 victory for Fenerbahce seems likely, considering their home form and goal-scoring ability.
